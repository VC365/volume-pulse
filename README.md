# Volume Pulse

Volume Pulse is a lightweight volume control utility for Linux systems. It runs in the system tray and allows you to control your audio output using mouse scroll, tray icon clicks, or your systemâ€™s volume keys. Volume Pulse is written in C and uses the GTK2 toolkit for its graphical interface.

## Features

* Tray icon with real-time volume status
* Mouse scroll support to increase/decrease volume
* Left click to toggle mute
* Middle click can be set to open a mixer or mute
* Optional notification popups
* Volume shortcuts support (XF86 keys)
* Simple config file for customization

## Installation

### Requirements

* A GTK-based desktop environment
* `pulseaudio`
* `pavucontrol` (for mixer)
* `libnotify`
* `libgtk-2-dev`

### Using the installer script

```bash
chmod a+x install.sh
./install.sh install
```

This installs the binary to `/usr/bin/volume-pulse` and sets up the config file at `~/.config/volume-pulse/config.conf`.

To uninstall:

```bash
./install.sh uninstall
```

## Usage

Once installed, just run:

```bash
volume-pulse &
```

It will start in the system tray.

## Configuration

Edit `~/.config/volume-pulse/config.conf` to customize behavior.

Example config:

```ini
volume_increase = 5
max_volume = 200%

middle_click_action = mixer
mixer = pavucontrol

use_notifications = false
use_shortcuts = false
```

## CLI Options

You can also control volume from terminal:

```bash
volume-pulse -u   # Volume up
volume-pulse -d   # Volume down
volume-pulse -m   # Toggle mute
volume-pulse -s   # Show volume level
volume-pulse -v   # Version info
```
